Explanatory memorandum

By 2022, a broad scientific consensus has emerged that eliminating all future greenhouse gas emissions, even on an accelerated timeline, is no longer 
sufficient to prevent the planet's average temperature from rising above 1, 5 C during this century. Along with rapidly decarbonizing the global economy 
and adapting to inevitable climate change, the global community must also remove excess CO2 and other GHGs from the atmosphere through a range of carbon 
dioxide removal (CDR) pathways, or negative emissions technologies (NETs). According to the 2018 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
report on global warming:

“All pathways [that] limit warming to 1.5C use Carbon Dioxide Removal…. Unless affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CDR becomes feasible 
and available at scale well before 2050, pathways to 1.5C will become difficult to realize.”[1]

Therefore, by 2050, the global negative emissions capacity must reach billions of tons per year. To achieve this goal, the main negative emissions  
policy priorities should be: 

1.) increased investment in, and deployment of, high-quality NETs ; and 2.) reduce unit costs by accelerating scale and learning. The authors believe 
that Luxembourg can play a leading role in supporting these short-term goals by putting in place a market-based incentive structure capable of generating 
and sustaining early demand for negative emissions projects as well as stimulating investment. This bill aims to implement a new program to accelerate 
investment in CDR projects, partially modeled and adapted on the renewable energy subsidy tariffs already in place in Luxembourg and in other countries.

The purpose of this law is to promote investments and the large-scale deployment of projects aimed at capturing and eliminating carbon dioxide 
(CO2) in the atmosphere. To this end, a mechanism for demand support for NETs  is created for the implementation of investment projects aimed at 
eliminating carbon dioxide  from the atmosphere. 

Text of the bill

Art. 1st – Object.

This bill aims to establish a framework for the promotion and development of projects aimed at removing  (CO2) in the atmosphere both through NET 
projects located both within and outside of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

Art. 2. – Definitions.

For the purposes of this law, the following terms mean:

“applicant”: the natural or legal person(s) governed by private law and legal persons governed by public law other than the State who submit and 
 sign an application for the NET service agreement referred to in this law;
 
“carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)”: The number of metric tons of CO2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another 
greenhouse gas

“durable materials” any naturally occurring or manufactured material in which carbon dioxide can be reliably and durably stored for at least 100 years;

“negative emissions” , processes by  which atmospheric CO2e is removed  according to the criteria defined in article 3.

“Negative emissions technology (NET) service provider”: the applicant to whom NET service revenues shall be granted

“sustainable CO2e storage” storage of carbon dioxide in durable materials;

“negative emissions technology (NET) service”: process resulting from a national or foreign NET  project after which a net carbon removal or reduction 
 effect is verifiable;
 
“national NET project”: any project having as its goal the removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide within the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg 
and which may involve the grouping, common ownership and management of NET  assets which collectively carry out an negative emissions  service;

“foreign NET project”: any project aimed at eliminating atmospheric carbon dioxide outside the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;

“minimum threshold”: verifiable net elimination of 100 tons of CO2 per year.

“maximum threshold” verifiable net elimination of 10,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

“Negative emissions technology (NET) service tariff”: the level of financial compensation that a NET service provider shall receive for delivering 

specific NET related services that generate environmental, economic and/or social value.

“Minister”: Minister having the Environment in his/her attributions, hereinafter “the Minister”.

Art. 3. – Modality of eligibility.

(1) The Minister may grant financial compensation for negative emissions services
(2) The following NET project types are eligible for financial compensation under the terms referred to in this law:

        1. National NET projects performing negative emissions services above the minimum threshold;

        2. foreign NET projects from an applicant established in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg who holds at least 50% of the participation
        or the share of the total investment and performs a negative emissions service exceeding the minimum threshold without exceeding the maximum 
        threshold. Foreign NET  projects must additionally fulfill the criteria specified in Article 3 paragraphs 1 and 2.

Art. 4. – NET service tariff

NET service providers shall be eligible to receive financial compensation according to the NET service tariff established and governed by the Minister. 
The tariff shall comprise four separate, non-mutually exclusive value categories that NET service providers may receive compensation for depending on the 
scope of NET services performed by the NET project, and other project factors.  

(1) Carbon dioxide removal: the verified removal of CO2 and/or other greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere; and the utilization of such gasses in the 
production and/or completion of goods and/or services. Delivery of the emissions removal service is compulsory for all NET service projects that shall 
be supported through this programme, and is a prerequisite for compensation eligibility for all other categories.

(2) Durable carbon dioxide emissions storage: the verified storage of CO2 and/or other greenhouse gasses that have been removed from the atmosphere in 
materials, geological formations, or ocean-based reservoirs for a minimum period of 100 years. 

(3) Small projects. Project capacity and scale factors, providing incentives for smaller projects with relatively higher fixed costs associated with 
construction and/or operation;

(4) b) The NET project represents a novel and innovative form of negative emissions technology that has been assessed by the Minister to possess high 
impact, large-scale negative emissions potential in the future 

(5)  Co-beneficial services: verifiable project outcomes, resulting from a NET project, that create additional and quantifiable socio-economic, and/or 
environmental benefits  compatible with national objectives and public policy goals that are separate and distinct from the delivery of carbon dioxide 

removal and storage services. Co-benefits shall be established, quantified, and incorporated into the tariff at the discretion of the Minister, in 
consultation with ------- .
