I. EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

By 2022, a broad scientific consensus has emerged that eliminating all future greenhouse gas emissions, even on an accelerated timeline, is no longer sufficient to prevent the planet's average temperature from rising above 1.5 C during this century. Along with rapidly decarbonizing the global economy and adapting to inevitable climate change, the global community must also remove excess CO2 and other GHGs from the atmosphere through a range of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) pathways, or negative emissions technologies (NETs). According to the 2018 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on global warming:

“All pathways [that] limit warming to 1.5C use Carbon Dioxide Removal…. Unless affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CDR becomes feasible and available at scale well before 2050, pathways to 1.5C will become difficult to realize.”

Therefore, by 2050, the global negative emissions capacity must reach billions of tons per year. To achieve large scale negative emissions in a 2050 timeframe, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is equally clear that investment in research and development, and NET deployment cannot wait, and must commence in the immediate near-term:

“Unless affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CDR becomes feasible and available at scale well before 2050, pathways to 1.5C will become difficult to realize.” 

Therefore, the main negative emissions policy priorities at present should be: 

1.) Increased investment in and deployment of high-quality, verifiable NETs; and 
2.) the reduction of NET capital and operating costs through accelerated scale-up and learning. 

Luxembourg is well positioned to play a global leadership role in supporting these near-term goals by putting in place a market-based incentive structure that will generate and sustain early demand for negative emissions projects, accelerating investment and project completion. 

To this end, this legislation aims to implement a negative emissions tariff, a new programme partially modeled on and adapted from the renewable energy feed-in tariff program already in place in Luxembourg, and several  EU member states. Historically, renewable energy feed-in tariffs have played a critically impactful role in dramatically increasing the supply of solar and wind energy resources, spurring innovation and production capacity, and lowering technology costs. The Luxembourg Negative Emissions Tariff (L-NET) adapts and applies common policy elements from the renewable energy feed-in tariff to the negative emissions context. 

II. TEXT OF THE BILL

ART. 1st – Object.

This bill establishes a framework for the promotion and development of negative emissions technology (NET) projects that remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and are located both within and outside of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

ART. 2. – Definitions.

For the purposes of this law, the following terms mean:

 "Project" the natural or legal person(s) governed by private law and legal persons governed by public law other than the State who submit and sign an application for the NET service agreement referred to in this law;
 
 “Carbon dioxide or CO2": the most common of the six primary greenhouse gases produced from anthropogenic sources, consisting on a molecular level of a single carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.

“Carbon utilization”: the use of carbon dioxide as an input or component in the production of products or completion of services. 

“Durable CO2 storage”: the secure and verifiable storage of carbon dioxide in materials and geological formations for periods no shorter in length than 1000 years;

“Minister”: Minister, or Ministers, having the Environment in his/her attributions, hereinafter “the Minister”.

“National NET project”: any project having as its goal the removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide within the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and which may involve the grouping, common ownership and management of NET assets which collectively carry out an negative emissions  service;

“Negative emissions": processes by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere according to the criteria defined in article 3.

“Negative emissions tariff”: the level of payment that a NET service provider shall receive for delivering verified NET related services.

“Negative emissions tariff programme year”: A period commencing on January 1 and concluding on December 31 of each year during which i. NET service applications may be submitted and approved for NET payments, and ii. Specific tariff compensation levels have been established by the Minister and not subject to change for the duration of that programme year.

“Negative emissions technology (NET) service”: processes resulting from a national or foreign NET project by which verifiable net carbon removal from the atmosphere is achieved;

“Negative emissions technology (NET) service provider”: the applicant to whom NET service payments shall be granted for the delivery of NET services.

“Verified carbon dioxide removal”; forms of carbon dioxide removal that can be directly volumetrically metered and reported on a metric tonne basis synchronously with the removal activity using a methodology or methodologies that have been approved by the Minister.”

“Verified carbon dioxide storage”; forms of carbon dioxide storage that can be directly volumetrically metered and reported on a metric tonne unit basis synchronously with the storage activity using a methodology or methodologies that have been approved by the Minister.”

ART. 3. – Modality of project eligibility.

(1) The Minister may grant financial compensation for negative emissions services based on metric tonnes of CO2 removed from the atmosphere and/or durably stored; and for co-benefits that produce additional positive economic, social and environmental outcomes.

(2) The following NET project categories are eligible for financial compensation, or payments, under the terms referred to in this law:

Domestic NET Projects that are located within the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg performing negative emissions services above the minimum threshold;

Foreign NET Projects that are located outside of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. To be eligible to participate in the negative emissions tariff programme Foreign NET projects must result in durable carbon dioxide storage, as defined in Article 4. paragraphs 1 and 2.

ART. 4. – Negative emissions tariff value categories and terms.

NET service providers shall be eligible to receive financial compensation according to the following terms:

Compensation for NET service providers shall be transacted on a volumetric, performance basis with payment awarded for verified metric tonnes of CO2 (€ per MT CO2) removed and/or durably stored during the term of the contract; and for other quantifiable co-benefits that result from such projects. 

The negative emissions tariff shall comprise three separate value categories that NET service providers shall be eligible to receive payments for. Value categories are non-mutually exclusive. NET projects that fulfill the mandatory carbon dioxide removal requirement (Value Category A), and also result in verified carbon dioxide storage, and/or one or more co-benefits shall be compensated at a tariff comprising all applicable value categories:

Verified carbon dioxide removal value category: the verified removal of CO2 from the atmosphere; and the utilization of such gasses in the production and/or completion of goods and/or services. At a minimum it shall be compulsory for participating NET service projects to fulfill the carbon dioxide removal value category as a condition of payment eligibility for payment under this programme.

Verified carbon dioxide storage value category: the verified storage of CO2 that has been removed from the atmosphere in materials, geological formations, or ocean-based reservoirs for a minimum period of 1000 years. 

(3) NET projects that are rated to remove five hundred or fewer but not less than one hundred metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per year shall be eligible for incremental tariff adjustment to compensate for comparatively higher fixed costs associated with construction and/or operation for projects of this scale. The level of additional payment applied to small-scale NET projects shall be determined and adjusted at the discretion of the Minister. 

(4) At the commencement of the first programme year of the negative emissions tariff programme the following minimum tariffs shall be applied to each value category.

Verified carbon dioxide removal value category - € 150 / metric tonne of CO2.
Verified carbon dioxide storage value category - € 300 / metric tonne of CO2.
Co-benefits value category -  € 50 / metric tonne of CO2.

The Minister shall have authority to adjust tariff levels corresponding to the above     value categories on an annual basis in advance of the commencement of each programme year. 

(5) The Minister shall establish the compensation rates (€ / metric tonne CO2) for each value category based on the completed economic assessment of negative emissions and carbon dioxide storage technologies, and of co-benefits that have been designated by the Minister. The Minister shall be directed to publicly announce the initial tariffs for the first programme year by no later than December 1, 2024.

(6) Each year the Minister shall be authorized to adjust value category compensation rates for the subsequent year based on analysis of real market and technology trends and developments. Adjusted tariffs will be made publicly known and placed in effect on December 30 of each year prior to the subsequent programme year commencement on January 1. 

ART. 5. - Negative emissions technology certification
[under development]

ART. 6. – Negative emissions tariff programme funding sources and terms.

(1). The Minister shall grant, within the limits of budgetary appropriations, public funds in support of the negative emissions tariff programme. 

(2). All programme costs and liabilities associated with the negative emissions tariff programme implementation, operations and payments shall be fiscally supported with public revenues raised annually from a levy of the subscription tax.

(3) Annual funding allocated in support of the negative emissions tariff programme for each programme year will be limited to the total revenues gained during the previous fiscal year from the annual subscription tax levy referred to in paragraph 2, Art. 5. 

(4) Once annual allocated funding for the negative emissions tariff has been fully subscribed through the NET service provider application process, application acceptance will be suspended until the commencement of the following programme year.

(5) All allocated funds that remain at the end of the programme year will be added to allocated funds for the following programme year.  

ART. 7. - NET service provider application procedures

Applications for participation in the negative emissions tariff programme by NET service providers may be requested by the legal representative of the NET service provider entity or entities in the name and on behalf of several natural or legal persons who will be the recipients of payments, and are part of the said entity.

The negative emissions tariff programme application period shall commence on January 1 and conclude on December 31 of each year, or until funding that has been allocated for the current programme year has been fully subscribed. 

The Minister shall be directed to implement a web-based platform by which NET service providers and other interested parties may review full programme information, and complete and submit applications via a digital form.

The aforementioned form is to be completed by the applicant.

NET service provider applications shall be received, reviewed and approved on a first-come, first-served basis.

In the event of adaptation of the EDC project by the applicant once the application has been approved, (on the advice of the energy adviser,) the applicant may submit a request with a view to obtaining a new agreement in principle.

As part of the review of the application materials investigation of the files, (the Environment Administration?) reserves the right to request the production of any document it deems necessary to be able to ascertain compliance with the conditions imposed by this regulation.

ART. 8. NET service contract terms and disbursal of NET service payments 

NET service providers shall be compensated for NET services rendered at a fixed tariff for a maximum term of 5-years. The tariff level shall not be subject to change during the 5-year term.

The NET service provider may voluntarily discontinue participation at any point during the maximum 5-year term.

Payments shall be made to NET service providers on a quarterly basis. 

Payments shall be transferred directly to the bank accounts of natural persons, legal persons governed by private law or legal persons governed by public law, other than the State, who are beneficiaries.

ART. 9. Rules governing the suspension of NET contracts and payments

(1) In the event of an inaccurate or incomplete declaration with a view to the granting of payments provided for by this law, payments shall be refused and, in the case where it has already been granted and liquidated, the restitution of the unduly affected payments is required with retroactive effect. The same applies when the beneficiary, at the request of the Minister, does not communicate the declaration, information and documents requested.
