# The Luxembourg Negative Emissions Tariff (L-NET)

The L-NET is a new legislative proposal (2022) that aims to rapidly catalyze carbon dioxide removal (CDR), or negative emissions technology (NET), investment and deployment both within Luxembourg and abroad. As law the bill would establish a demand support framework for CDR/NET projects that is inspired by the renewable energy feed-in tariff (FIT) model that has played a critical market development role for solar, wind and other clean electricity sources in Europe and other regions. Under the L-NET qualified NET project developers would receive direct payment for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air, durably storing CO2, and or producing other economic, social and environmental benefits.
The L-NET concept and legislation was collaboratively developed by Sven Clement, an eleced member of the Luxembourg Parliament (Pirate Party) and the OpenAir Collective, with input from dozens of global subject experts. 
The L-NET will be introduced as Legislation in June 2022.
