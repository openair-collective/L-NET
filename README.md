I. Explanatory memorandum

By 2022, a broad scientific consensus has emerged that eliminating all future greenhouse gas emissions, even on an accelerated timeline, is no longer sufficient to prevent the planet's average temperature from rising above 1, 5 C during this century. Along with rapidly decarbonizing the global economy and adapting to inevitable climate change, the global community must also remove excess CO2 and other GHGs from the atmosphere through a range of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) pathways, or negative emissions technologies (NETs). According to the 2018 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on global warming:

“All pathways [that] limit warming to 1.5C use Carbon Dioxide Removal…. Unless affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CDR becomes feasible and available at scale well before 2050, pathways to 1.5C will become difficult to realize.”

Therefore, by 2050, the global negative emissions capacity must reach billions of tons per year. To achieve large scale negative emissions in a 2050 timeframe, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is equally clear that investment in research and development, and deployment cannot wait, and must commence in the near-term:

“Unless affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CDR becomes feasible and available at scale well before 2050, pathways to 1.5C will become difficult to realize.” 

Therefore, the main negative emissions policy priorities at present should be: 

1.) Increased investment in and deployment of high-quality, verifiable NETs; and 2.) the reduction of NET capital and operating costs through accelerated scale-up and learning. 

Luxembourg is well positioned to play a global leadership role in supporting these near-term goals by putting in place a market-based incentive structure that will generate and sustain early demand for negative emissions projects, accelerating investment and project completion. To this end, this legislation aims to implement a negative emissions tariff, a new programme partially modeled on and adapted from the renewable energy feed-in tariff program already in place in Luxembourg, and EU member states countries. Historically, renewable energy feed-in tariffs have played a critically impactful role in dramatically increasing the supply of solar and wind energy resources, spurring innovation and production capacity, and lowering technology costs. The Luxembourg Negative Emissions Tariff (L-NET) adapts and applies common policy elements from the renewable energy feed-in tariff to the negative emissions context.
